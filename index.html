        <p id="about">I am a software and full-stack web developer based in Kirkland, Washington. I have written projects in a number of 
            different languages and using a variety of technologies. I enjoy creating apps from the ground up with unique
            user needs in mind. The following is an overview of some of the projects I've worked on, including both 
            those I created alone and those I collaborated on as part of a team.</p>
